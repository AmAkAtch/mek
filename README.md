**_How it Works_**
A Grid app, where based on order of the clicks individual boxes will change state and remember the order of click it was pressed while displaying the number. You can reset the grid with reste button.

**\***Extra Note**\***
After the project was submitted I was not satsfied with incomplete project...

1. So, First Unfixed CSS was finished, which was unfinished due to lack of time on exact day -> that Reflects to the first commit on Project
2. Than afterwards, I had an Idea on solving the problem of Reset, So I implemented the button -> That reflects to second commit
3. Finally, I wanted to complete the project so Took help from AI to form the logic of what I had in mind and after some trial and error, I had completed the logic on my own -> that reflects to the final commit of the project
